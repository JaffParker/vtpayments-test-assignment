## Good to know

There are libraries that APIs that you should familiarize yourself with before diving into this project. It is presumed that you already have knowledge of Typescript that the latest ES features.

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - the query language of our API.
- [Apollo GraphQL server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - a very powerful implementation of GraphQL.
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) - our ORM
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps) - what ties it all together and makes it work. Most organized Typescript web framework out there yet.
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - the only and only date manipulation library that we use.
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - a collection of useful functions so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
